I want to add home impermanence with the following strategy. Ask me questions to improve this plan.
We will not use the home manager impermanence module. Persisted paths will be added to configuration.nix
Home files/folders will be persisted to new subvolumes.
Dotfiles will be persisted to @persist-dotfiles, mounted at /persist-dotfiles (ie .android, .mozilla, .var etc)
Userfiles will be persisted to @persist-userfiles, mounted at /persist-userfiles (Desktop, Documents, Downloads)
We will want new snapper configurations for the new subvolumes.
We want to keep paths narrow in scope instead of broad (ie .config/kate, not .config)
The plan needs to include how to wipe the home subvolume at boot. (do we need a @home-blank subvolume?)
The plan also needs to include how to create the new subvolumes and how to migrate existing data into the new subvolumes.
Any questions?

1. wiped on every reboot
2. the same way we handle persisted root paths
3. not sure boot timing, but we need to keep sops in mind so that nixos-rebuild boot still works. yes lets use neededForBoot
4. lets consider some specific cache dirs
5. ~/Android/Sdk is userfile. .local/share is dotfile. Lets persist .gradle, .npm, .cargo
6. Application status boundaries: lets stick to the strict definition of a dotfile. If it starts with a dot, it's a dotfile.
7. Safe, live USB
8. yes lets create a @home snapshot. Lets also create a copy of home called @home-backup for safety
9. same snapper settings
10. lets try to enumerate everything for starters
